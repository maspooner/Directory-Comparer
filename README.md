### Project Purpose ###

Doing manual backups on an external hard drive, I needed some quick way to compare which files were backed up and which weren't.
For documents, I could use a program that compares actual content differences.
But for music, videos, and pictures, a simple is-the-file-there check would suffice.

### How do I get set up? ###

Run the latest EXE in the bin folder.
The code requires no extra setup.
