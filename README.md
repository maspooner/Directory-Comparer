This project lists the difference between two directories.

### Summary Information ###
Version 2.0.0.0

### Project Members ###
- Matthew Spooner (since inception)

### Project Purpose ###

Doing manual backups on an external hard drive, I needed some quick way to compare which files were backed up and which weren't.
For documents, I could use a program that compares actual content differences.
But for music, videos, and pictures, a simple is-the-file-there check would suffice.
